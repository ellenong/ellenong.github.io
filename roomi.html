With different personalities, living styles, and preferences in the mix, living with others can be difficult to navigate when people don’t see eye to eye. <span style="font-weight:600">How can we develop a platform that can alleviate the hard parts of living with others?</span></h6>

			<h2>What makes living together difficult?</h2>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h6>To pinpoint what specifically made living with others difficult, we carefully crafted 8 research questions to understand users’ living situation, living preferences, and conflict resolution tactics. We conducted 5 user interviews with college students between the ages of 18-22.<br></h6>
		</div>
		<div class ="text">

		<div>
			<h5><br>Finding 1. The patterns</h5>
			<h6>From all the qualitative interview responses we collected, we created an affinity map to categorize the answers into general statements. Based on the general categories that had the most related responses, we found 3 things that users wanted to improve their living situations: <span style="font-weight:600">Communication, Accountability, and Equity</span>.</h6>

						<h5>Walking in Frank's shoes</h5>
						<h6>Frank is a USC student living in an off-campus apartment with 3 of his best friends. Frank realizes that his living style is different from his friends’ and is tired of reminding his friends to clean up after themselves. He's resorted to doing all the chores himself to avoid escalating the situation. Frank needs <span style="font-weight:600">a way to effectively communicate </span>what chores should be done while ensuring that his <span style="font-weight:600">roommates are held accountable for their share of work.<span></h6>

						<h5>Walking in Lucy's shoes</h5>
						<h6>Lucy, a sophomore at NYU, is living with her friends in off-campus housing. This is her first time living alone so she does her best to remember her responsibilities, but often forgets to clean up after herself due to her busy schedule. As a result, she’s noticed that she’s grown distant from her housemates and they seem to regularly be upset with her. Lucy needs <span style="font-weight:600">a better technique to remember </span>what chores to complete, and thus <span style="font-weight:600">maintain peace </span>among her household.</h6>

They are then directed to the dashboard, where they can initiate the creation of tasks that are then added to their to-do list and calendar.<br><br>To demonstrate the experience of returning users, such as Lucy, we introduced the nudge function, which serves as a reminder for users to complete their tasks through push notifications.</h6>

			<h2>Tutoria</h2>
		</div>
		<div class = "column">
			<h5>Background</h5>
			<h6>Tutoria is a non-profit organization committed to providing free tutoring services to underserved communities. On the website, volunteers can sign up to tutor clients in English or Citizenship and clients could sign up to match with volunteer tutors to receive aid in their educational needs.</h6>
			<h5>Project</h5>
			<h6>Tutoria’s goal was to launch a match report screen so volunteer tutors can better manage their clients and requests. I was tasked to redesign the screens that were left by a previous UX designer to be ready for launching. Over the course of the project, I conducted extensive research, designed and prototyped, and met with the project manager, founder, and other UX designers.</h6>

			<h2>What's going on?</h2>
		</div>
		<h6>Upon joining the team, I met with one of the past UX designers and project manager to understand the scope of the project. I was tasked to work on the designs for the match report, a rundown for tutors to match with their clients and see client details. Looking at the match report designs, I was instantly overwhelmed and confused about what was going on. However, this was not enough to begin the designing process.</h6>

			<h6>HYPOTHESIS</h6>
		</div>
		<div class ="header">
			<h2>The current match report designs are difficult to digest.</h2>
		</div>
		<h6>I hypothesized that the current designs were overwhelming and confusing for tutors to digest and that tutors can not differentiate between their match requests and their matches.</h6>
	</div>

		<div class ="lightheader">
			<h6>RESEARCH</h6>
		</div>
		<div class ="header">
			<h2>Let the tutors decide.</h2>
		</div>
		<h6>Because these pages are meant to be used by tutors, I went straight to the source. I conducted 5 qualitative user interviews to assess what details they would like to know to successfully track their clients' progress and how they perceived the current screens.</h6>
		<div> 
			<h5><br>Finding 1. What tutors want to know</h5>
			<h6>Tutors liked that they could track when they matched with a client and the time frame between their first meeting date and last meeting date. They also liked that they could see the statuses for their messages and timesheets with their clients. All in all, tutors liked the information that was provided in the current match design.</h6>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h5>Finding 2. Overwhelming layout</h5>
			<h6>While tutors liked the content of the cards, they felt overwhelmed with the bright colors and the information clumped closely together. With so many different statuses, tutors were confused about what each meant. They felt that it took a lot of brain power to fully digest all of the information.</h6>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div id="problem">
		<div class ="lightheader">
			<h6>PROBLEM</h6>
		</div>
		<div class ="header">
			<h2>Managing numerous clients is a headache</h2>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h6>Volunteer tutors find it difficult to manage and track their matches and match requests with the current match report design. How can we provide this information in one place while making the information easily digestible for the volunteer tutors?</h6>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h5><br>Problems with the current design</h5>
			<h6><strong>1. Information and sensory overload </strong>- The current design uses high contrast colors and homogenous font hierarchy to indicate to the tutors statuses of different aspects of their relationship with the client. This is all laid out in rows after each other, 4 out of 5 users found this to be confusing and overwhelming.</h6>
			<h6><strong>2. Unclear purpose </strong>- Users wondered what each status meant. There is a disconnect between the designs and their purpose that is preventing tracking and managing an easy process for tutors</h6>

		<div class ="header">
			<h2>What makes living together difficult?</h2>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h6>To pinpoint what specifically made living with others difficult, we carefully crafted 8 research questions to understand users’ living situation, living preferences, and conflict resolution tactics. We conducted 5 user interviews with college students between the ages of 18-22. </h6>
		</div>
		<div class ="text">
			<div class ="text-column" >
				<h6>“I dont think it’s fair right now because not everyone is contributing with chores”<br><br>“I wish I had a set schedule of when to do chores rather than doing it whenever”<br><br>“I am a non confrontational person. It bothers me, but I rather do the chores rather than make it a big deal”</h6>
			</div>
			<div class="text-column">
				<h6>“I am very grateful that my roommates does most of chores, I do like 10%”<br><br>“I don’t think my roommate minds doing the chores”<br><br>“I tend to forget to pick up after myself, I do feel bad that my housemate usually cleans up after me."</h6>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h5>Finding 1. The patterns</h5>
			<h6>From all the qualitative interview responses we collected, we created an affinity map to categorize the answers into general statements. Based on the general categories that had the most related responses, we found 3 things that users wanted to improve their living situations: Communication, Accountability, and Equity.</h6>
			<div class="images">
				<img  class="image" src ="img/affinitymap.png"  alt="logo">
			</div>
		</div>
			<h5>Finding 2. The two types of roommates</h5>
			<h6>From all the answers we collected, we found there were two types of roommates and some in between. We created 2 user personas to represent the target users of Roomi: Frustrated Frank and Lazy Lucy.</h6>

						<h5>Walking in Frank's shoes</h5>
						<h6>Frank is a USC student living in an off-campus apartment with 3 of his best friends. Frank realizes that his living style is different from his friends’ and is tired of reminding his friends to clean up after themselves. He's resorted to doing all the chores himself to avoid escalating the situation. Frank needs <strong>a way to effectively communicate </strong>what chores should be done while ensuring that his <strong>roommates are held accountable for their share of work.<strong></h6>

					<div class="images">
						<img  class="image-row" src ="img/lucy.png"  alt="logo">
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Walking in Lucy's shoes</h5>
						<h6>Lucy, a sophomore at NYU, is living with her friends in off-campus housing. This is her first time living alone so she does her best to remember her responsibilities, but often forgets to clean up after herself due to her busy schedule. As a result, she’s noticed that she’s grown distant from her housemates and they seem to regularly be upset with her. Lucy needs <strong>a better technique to remember </strong>what chores to complete, and thus <strong>maintain peace </strong>among her household.</h6>

They are then directed to the dashboard, where they can initiate the creation of tasks that are then added to their to-do list and calendar.<br><br>To demonstrate the experience of returning users, such as Lucy, we introduced the nudge function, which serves as a reminder for users to complete their tasks through push notifications.</h6>

				<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
			</div>
			<h6><strong>1. Advocating for the users </strong>- Within the organization, I observed that the founder had a significant influence on design decisions. Utilizing my research skills became crucial in defending my design choices and advocating for the needs of the users, ensuring that they came first throughout the design process.</h6>
			<h6><br><strong>2. Working with limited resources </strong>– Working within a non-profit organization, I encountered challenges in implementing design changes due to limitations with what can be developed and what couldn’t. There were also limited resources on recruiting participants and conducting user research. However, this experience taught me the importance of embracing creativity to overcome these obstacles and find alternative solutions.</h6>
